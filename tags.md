<p>MSFA (FD) tags are up for renewal this year. In order to receive your renewal from MVA, MSFA must authorize your tag renewal. There is a $10 fee from MSFA to do this. It is important you do this immediately as you may not receive your registration renewal if you fail to do this.</p>

<p>The Wheaton Volunteer Rescue Squad Alumni Association is assisting WVRS as payment processor for MSFA tag renewals. All funds collected by this web page will be forwarded to the WVRS Treasurer.</p>

<p>You can pay here using PayPal or credit card. The MSFA fee is $10 plus $1 for the PayPal fee for a total of $11. If you prefer, you can also send a check made out to WVRS Alumni Association for $10 to Lou's home address.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: If you have more than one MSFA tag issued to you, please complete this form for EACH tag. You can add each to the cart then click continue shopping to return to this page, then complete the transaction.</p>

<p><b>Be sure to include your tag number and name. Tags start with FD followed by 5 numbers. You should enter 7 characters, i.e. FD12345.</b></p>
