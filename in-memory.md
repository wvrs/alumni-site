	<p>December 17, 1960 – April 19, 2014</p>
	<p>The members of the Wheaton Volunteer Rescue Squad mourn the loss of President and Life Member Tom Brown. His untimely passing leaves an immense hole in our hearts and our organization.

Tom rose through the ranks, serving as a Fire Rescue Sergeant, Fire Rescue Lieutenant and ending his front-line service as a Fire Rescue Captain and Duty Officer.</p>
